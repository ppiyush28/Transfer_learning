    "#### Advantages\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "This model was more specifcally built for a certain use case. While it was a major breakthrough in 1998, it does not do as well with color images. Most image recognition problems would require RGB images for better recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the model isnât very deep, it struggles to scan for all features thus producing poor performing models. If the Neural Network isnât fed with enough features from the training images then it would be difficult for the model to generalize and create an accurate model."
