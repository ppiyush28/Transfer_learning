    "LeNet was used in detecting handwritten cheques by banks based on MNIST dataset. Fully connected networks and activation functions were previously known in neural networks. LeNet-5 introduced convolutional and pooling layers. LeNet-5 is believed to be the base for all other ConvNets."

    "#### Advantages\n",
    "This network was a good introduction into the world of neural networks and is really simple to understand. It works well for character recognition images.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Disadvantages\n",
    "This model was more specifcally built for a certain use case. While it was a major breakthrough in 1998, it does not do as well with color images. Most image recognition problems would require RGB images for better recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the model isn’t very deep, it struggles to scan for all features thus producing poor performing models. If the Neural Network isn’t fed with enough features from the training images then it would be difficult for the model to generalize and create an accurate model."
